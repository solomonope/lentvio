The mathematical formula for the calculator is as follows:
Funding Amount required = y
F= total Repayment amount
I Single Flat Fee  =  ith percentage of funding Ammount
Repayment Amount (Amount + fee) = F

Therefore to determine F, we use the following formula:
F = (y * r) + y 
Also, i = y * r
Example: if y = 20,000, r = 6%, 
Then, i = 20,000 * 6% = 1,200
Therefore , F = (20,000 * 6%) + 20,000 = 21,200
Or (y + i) => (20,000 + 1,200) = 21,200
